# Test API Call

This repository is made to test the possibility to use an api with ease

## Install

Before anything, the `install_dependencies.sh` script must be launched (as root).

After this, the `compile.sh` script can be used to compile the code and create the 
"ApiCall" executable in the "bin" folder

## Api used

The Api used in the test is a summy api available online : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

This Api consumes and produces content at the Json format (no XML anymore !)
